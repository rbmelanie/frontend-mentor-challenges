### What I learned

I did this challenge after watching a video from Kevin Powell explaining grid using this layout as an example. Using his starter file, which included custom properties, resets, etc. helped me learn a lot more about how professional developers organize their css styles and plan their work (with custom properties).

Working with grid on this layout showed me grid doesn't have to be bloated or complicated to achieve nice and responsive designs.
